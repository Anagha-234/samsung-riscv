# Samsung-RISC-V 
This repository contains the work related to various tasks based on RISC-V instruction analysis and simulation. The tasks involve understanding and working with the RISC-V toolchain, compiling C programs, optimizing code using different compiler flags, and decoding RISC-V instructions.

# Task 1: Setting Up the RISC-V Toolchain
Objective: Set up the RISC-V toolchain on my machine.
Steps:
Created a GitHub repository named "samsung-riscv".
Installed the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI link from the provided PDF.
Followed setup steps from the C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos.
Captured snapshots of the setup process and uploaded them.

# Task 2: RISC-V Optimization Flags and Object Dump Analysis
A simple C program was written to compute a basic task (Approximation of sine wave).
The program was compiled using RISC-V GCC/SPIKE with two different optimization flags: -O1 and -Ofast.
The RISC-V object dumps for both optimization levels were generated and analyzed to observe the differences in the resulting machine code.
Key Learning:
Optimization flags -O1 and -Ofast have a significant impact on the efficiency and performance of the generated machine code.
The object dumps were analyzed to understand how the compiler optimizes the program under different optimization levels.

# Task 3: RISC-V Instruction Breakdown and 32-Bit Encoding
Objective: Identify and decode 15 unique RISC-V instructions and determine their 32-bit instruction codes.
Steps:
Reviewed RISC-V documentation to understand instruction types (R, I, S, B, U, J).
Analyzed the riscv-objdump output to find 15 unique instructions.
Decoded each instruction into its 32-bit binary encoding and explained the components (opcode, funct3, funct7, etc.).
Uploaded the decoded instructions and explanations to the repository.

# Task 4: Functional Simulation of RISC-V Core

Add Relevant Signals:
Expand the module tree in the SST (Signal Selection Tree) panel.
Drag and drop important signals (e.g., clk, RN, NPC, WB_OUT) into the Waves panel.
PC (Program Counter):
This signal tells us which instruction is currently being fetched or is in a particular stage of the pipeline (often the fetch or write-back stage, depending on the design). In a 5-stage pipeline, the PC is usually passed along the pipeline stages.
WB_OUT (Write-Back Output):
This signal represents the final result of an instruction after it has been processed through all pipeline stages. For an arithmetic instruction like an addition, WB_OUT should hold the computed result.

Observation of output waveform
1. Instruction 1 at address 0x1000:

# Task 5: Documentation and Repository Update

## üìå Overview
Task 5 focuses on updating the project repository with proper documentation, visuals, and pin details to ensure clarity and completeness.

## üìå Project Name and Overview
**Project Name:** Button Press Counter on VSDSquadron Mini (RISC-V Board)

**Overview:** This project implements a button press counter using the **built-in button** available on the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Board. The button is connected to **GPIOA Pin 2**, and every button press is counted and displayed via **UART**. This approach eliminates the need for an external button and ensures ease of testing directly on the board.

## üîπ Components Required
- **VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Board** (with built-in button)

## üìå Circuit Connection
Since the button is inbuilt, no external wiring is required. However, for reference, the table below details the key connections:

| **Pin**         | **Board Pin** | **Description** |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Button**     | GPIOA_2     | Built-in button input (Active Low) |
